# cervical_cancer_cell_classification
According to the World Health Organization, cervical cancer is a significant health concern for women worldwide. The Papanicolaou or pap test is an effective tool for early detection of the disease, which can help prevent deaths. However, the process of analyzing pap test results, which involves a pathologist examining images of the cells, is time-consuming and prone to human error. In developing countries, doctors often rely on manual examination with microscopes, resulting in a shortage of available services.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a methodology that focuses on finding an effective convolutional neural network (CNN) model for analyzing digital pap smears. The approach involves two stages . In the first stage, different pre-trained models such as DenseNet, EfficientNet, ResNet, and VGG19 are used to classify four classes of cervical cells on high-resolution $(250 \times 250)$ cell images belonging to 460 patients. In the second stage, the best previous model is selected, and through fine-tuning techniques, the best hyperparameters are selected. This study uses different performance metrics for high-resolution classification, such as accuracy, sensitivity, precision, and specificity.
